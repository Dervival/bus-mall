- Marketing Team user stories:
  1.As a member of the marketing team, I want a focus group to be able to select their favorite from a group of items, so that I can see what proposed inventory will be popular.
  1.As a member of the marketing team, I want all interactable images to come from the assets provided, so that the focus group is only able to select from our current inventory.
  1.As a member of the marketing team, I want both number of clicks and numbers of views to be stored as information for our metrics, so that we can make sure that the number of times an item appears does not necessarily bias its popularity.
  1.As a member of the marketing team, I want the focus group to be able to go through the selection process 25 times, so that I have a sufficient amount of responses per person.

- Focus Group user stories:
  1.As a focus group member, I want to be able to see images of each item, so that I can make a more accurate first impression of what I'd see in a catalog.
  1.As a focus group member, I want a warning if my input is not valid or is not being used, so that I can avoid getting frustrated when the page doesn't seem to be responding.
  1.As a focus group member, I want unique images within the set of images being shown, so that I don't get confused as to which image to select.
  1.As a focus group member, I want unique images between sets of images, so that I can avoid the case of two sets of images having identical content and making me feel as though my input was ignored.

- Developer user stories:
  1.As a developer, I want to make the images all display at the same size, so that the layout is easier to manage.
  1.As a developer, I want to make the number of products that are shown at a time dynamic, so that if the marketing team wants to change how many products are being shown I can do so with minimal refactoring.
  1.As a developer, I want to eventually present the information gathered in a graph form, so that I can practice my skills in presenting information in ways other than lists or tables.
  1.As a developer, I want to eventually add some sort of storage for responses, so I don't need to collate information everytime a new focus group member makes responses.
